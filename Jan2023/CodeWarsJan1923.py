# Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
# Examples:
# Input: 42145 Output: 54421
# Input: 145263 Output: 654321
# Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

def descending_order(num):
    return int("".join(sorted(str(num), reverse=True)))
        
# Terminal game move function
# In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.
# Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
# Example:
# move(3, 6) should equal 15

def move(position, roll):
    return position + (roll * 2)
