# Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.
# This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);
# This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:
# 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
# 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
# 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
# 0, in other cases

# The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.
# What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

            char_count[char] += 1
        #if the character is already in the dictionary increase the count
